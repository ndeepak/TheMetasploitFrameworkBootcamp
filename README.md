This is the Metasploit Framework Bootcamp by INE notes made by [Deepak Nagarkoti](www.github.com/ndeepak).

> Lab Environment Setup
> 1. The preferred distribution of choice for this bootcamp is [Kali Linux](https://kali.org/downloads).
> 2. For our target system, we will be utilizing an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine called [Metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3) .
> 3. Metasploitable3 has two versions based on Win2k8 and Ubuntu 14.04.
> 4. The OVA virtual machine download: [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zgqsPZtAFiRj5-vNuvOM_MTc4BYLGRZB?usp=sharing)
