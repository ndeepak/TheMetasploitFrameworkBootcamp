        <li>Developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hdmoore">HD Moore</a> in 2003 </li>
        <li>Originally Developed in <b>Perl</b></li>
        <li>Rewritten in <b>Ruby</b> in 2007</li>
        <li>In 2009, it was acquired by Rapid7 (FUNDED)</li>
        <li>Second Major realeased in 2019, <b>Metasploit 5.0</b> (STABLE)</li>
        <li>In 2020, <b>Metasploit 6.0</b> (Used still in 2022 with other sub- version)</li>

    <h2> What is the Metasploit Framework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an open-source, robust penetration testing and exploitation framework that is used by penetration testers & Security researchers globally. </li>
        <li>It provides penetration testers with a robust infrastructure required to automate every stage of the penetration testing life cycle.</li>
        <li>It is also used to developed & test exploits and has one of the world's largest database of public, tested exploits.</li>
        <li>The Metasplots Framework is designed to be modular, allowing for new functionality to be implemented with ease. (Automation &  <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework">Open Source</a> )</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Metasploit Framework CLI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Metasploit Framework Command Line Interface (MSFcli) is a command line utility that is used to facilitate the creation of automation scripts that utilize Metasploit modules. </li>
        <li>It can be used to redirect output from other tools in to msfcli and vice versa.
        </li> <br>
        <b>Note</b>: MSFcli was discontinued in 2015, however, the same functionality can be leveraged through the MSFconsole.
    </ul>
